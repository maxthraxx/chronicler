//! File system watcher that publishes events to a broadcast channel.
//!
//! This module handles filesystem watching with debouncing and publishes standardized
//! `FileEvent`s to a broadcast channel. Multiple subscribers can listen to these events
//! and react accordingly (indexing, backup, validation, etc.).
